### Universal Translator
### Imagine you are in charge of IT at a large multinational e-commerce company. Users are 
### messaging you with IT issues in all their native languages. Your staff is from all over the ### world and speaks only their native languages. You need a universal translator!'''

### Tone Transformation
### Writing can vary based on the intended audience. ChatGPT can produce different tones.

# prompt = f"""
# Translate the following from slang to a business letter: 
# 'Dude, This is Joe, check out this spec on this standing lamp.'
# """
# response = get_completion(prompt)

### Format Conversion - ChatGPT can translate between formats. The prompt should describe the input and output formats.
# data_json = { "resturant employees" :[ 
#     {"name":"Shyam", "email":"shyamjaiswal@gmail.com"},
#     {"name":"Bob", "email":"bob32@gmail.com"},

# Translate the following python dictionary from JSON to an HTML \
# table with column headers and title: {data_json}
